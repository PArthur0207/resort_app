An app that can get reservations, book events, and all other things(Will add features later) in assosciation with the resort, will deploy when done

Concept/Workflow:

Users open the app and is met with the following choices:
1. Reserve a spot
    a. They will be asked the following questions:
        i. The date of their swimming
        ii. How many people in their party
        iii. What type of cottage will they be staying in
        iv. Their contact information
    b. After getting these information, the program will then calculate how much they need to pay, and show it to them
    c. They would then have the option to pay online or in person.
    d. Then the program will inform the server manager(an actual person), about the details and confirmation of payment
    e. After personally confirming the online payment, they are now reserved for that spot at that date, or they can pay on the day of their swimming
    f. They are then shown the rules and regulation of the resort

2. Book an event
    a. The user will be asked the following question:
        i. The date of their reservation
        ii. Make them choose if they want it to be excluded or not
        iii. Pick what bundle they will pick for the event(30pax or 50pax)
        iv. Their contact information
    b. After getting these information, the program will then calculate how much they need to pay, and show it to them
    c. They would then have the option to pay online or in person.
    d. Then the program will inform the server manager(an actual person), about the details and confirmation of payment
    e. After personally confirming the online payment, they are now reserved for that spot at that date, or they can pay on the day of their swimming
    f. They are then shown the rules and regulation of the resort

3. Book a room overnight
    a. The user will be asked the following:
        i. Their contact information
        ii. What time of room they need
        iii. Any extra ammenities they need
    b. After getting these information, the program will then calculate how much they need to pay, and show it to them
    c. They would then have the option to pay online or in person.
    d. Then the program will inform the server manager(an actual person), about the details and confirmation of payment
    e. After personally confirming the online payment, they are now reserved for that spot at that date, or they can pay on the day of their swimming
    f. They are then shown the rules and regulation of the resort

4. Ask about any information about the resort:
    a. They would be shown all the information regarding the resort
    b. There is an option where they can ask an AI(This will be implemented later on)

NOTES:
1. All Schedule conflicts should be resolved before the user can progress further. So there is a need of live checking of the schedules, constantly checking the options, this would be the exception handler(will figure out how to do this)
2. If there is a way to make this completely automatic and no need for confirmation during payment that would be applied

When "Server Managers" use the app they would see:
1. A calendar with the dates of reservation, they can click the date to see the full view
2. The amount paid online, and expenses by the resort can be documented here
3. They can also add reservation here in case that the user reserved their spot by verbal agreement and not by the use of the application

NOTES:
1. Will add more use for the server side in the future
