Resort Reservation App
An app that can get reservations, book events, and all other things (will add features later) in association with the resort. Will deploy when done.

Concept / Workflow
Users open the app and are met with the following choices:
1. Reserve a Spot
a. They will be asked the following questions:

i. The date of their swimming

ii. How many people in their party

iii. What type of cottage will they be staying in

iv. Their contact information

b. After getting this information, the program will calculate how much they need to pay and show it to them.
c. They will then have the option to pay online or in person.
d. The program will inform the server manager (an actual person) about the details and confirmation of payment.
e. After personally confirming the online payment, they are now reserved for that spot at that date — or they can pay on the day of their swimming.
f. They are then shown the rules and regulations of the resort.

2. Book an Event
a. The user will be asked the following questions:

i. The date of their reservation

ii. Choose if they want it to be excluded or not

iii. Pick what bundle they will pick for the event (30 pax or 50 pax)

iv. Their contact information

b. After getting this information, the program will calculate how much they need to pay and show it to them.
c. They will then have the option to pay online or in person.
d. The program will inform the server manager (an actual person) about the details and confirmation of payment.
e. After personally confirming the online payment, they are now reserved for that spot at that date — or they can pay on the day of their swimming.
f. They are then shown the rules and regulations of the resort.

3. Book a Room Overnight
a. The user will be asked the following:

i. Their contact information

ii. What type of room they need

iii. Any extra amenities they need

b. After getting this information, the program will calculate how much they need to pay and show it to them.
c. They will then have the option to pay online or in person.
d. The program will inform the server manager (an actual person) about the details and confirmation of payment.
e. After personally confirming the online payment, they are now reserved for that spot at that date — or they can pay on the day of their swimming.
f. They are then shown the rules and regulations of the resort.

4. Ask About Any Information About the Resort
a. They will be shown all the information regarding the resort.
b. There is an option where they can ask an AI (this will be implemented later on).

Notes for User Side
All schedule conflicts should be resolved before the user can progress further. So there is a need for live checking of the schedules, constantly checking the options — this would be the exception handler (will figure out how to do this).

If there is a way to make this completely automatic and remove the need for confirmation during payment, that will be applied.

Server Manager View
When "Server Managers" use the app, they will see:

A calendar with the dates of reservation — they can click the date to see the full view.

The amount paid online and expenses by the resort can be documented here.

They can also add reservations here in case the user reserved their spot by verbal agreement and not by the use of the application.

Notes for Server Side
Will add more use for the server side in the future.
